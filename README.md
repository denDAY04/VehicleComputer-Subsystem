VehicleComputer-Subsystem
=========================

Subsystem for a 3rd semester project at the Technical University of Denmark.

This subsystem is being developed as part of a full system that serves to provide a proof-of-concept project for an automated, digital PDA-ticket system for public transportation in Denmark. 

It being a semester project, part of the project description dictates that no thought shall be given to software security. As such, no such security will be incoorporated in this subsystem or its siblings. 

This part of the project constitude the proof-of-concept for a PDA client meant as an application (simulated through a JApplet), a computer meant to be incorporated in every bus and train, and a business-logic backend that serves as a managing interface between vehicle computers and the database backend system (not part of this subsystem) that will be accessible through RMI.
